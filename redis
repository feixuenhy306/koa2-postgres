client.expire('key1', 30);
redis.set('key', 100, 'ex', 10)

If you want to expire it 24 hrs later
client.expireat(key, parseInt((+new Date)/1000) + 86400);
Or
if you want it to expire exactly at the end of today, you can use .setHours on a new Date() object to get the time at the end of the day, and use that.
var todayEnd = new Date().setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
client.expireat(key, parseInt(todayEnd/1000))
